Project: Assignment 2, Mazeworld

Description: This project contains an A* search algorithm, a single robot and a multi robot Mazeworld problem, and a Blindrobot problem. The A* algorithm is able to solve different size mazes with different numbers of robots in it in addition to the blind robot problem where the algorithm has no idea where the robot nor where the walls are. 

Running the project: To test my A* search algorithm and different problem statements, use either the test_mazeworld.py file which tests the normal Mazeworld problem or the test_sensorless_py which tests the blind robot problem. With these two files you can use different heuristics as well: the null_heuristic or the manhattan_heuristic.
